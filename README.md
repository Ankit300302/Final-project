For this react app I have used Expo Router and I have installes axios function to interact with the API

# API used in this React application is JSearch from Rapid API
API Link: https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/jsearch?utm_source=youtube.com%2FJavaScriptMastery&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=DevRel
This API is used to find the real time job from different jobs platform like linkedin, indeed jobs and others as it maintaines real time data
 so it is a paid API it only allows about 250 API calls per month that's why I request you to search for this API and subscribe for the API free plain 
 to get the keys then you can use this app for testing as I am unable to provide with mine API keys

 Process to run the APP:
 1) install expo-router
 2) install axios and install whatever extra components is asked for your system
 3) Put the API keys in app/search/[id].js
 4) Put the API keys again in hook/useFetch.js
 5) Save all the changes and type the compand "npm start" to run this app

 App screenshots and testing video of the app is attached in about the app file
